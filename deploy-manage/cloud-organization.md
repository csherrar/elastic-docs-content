# Manage your Cloud organization [ec-organizations]

When you sign up to Elastic Cloud, you create an organization. This organization is the umbrella for all of your Elastic Cloud resources, users, and account settings. Every organization has a unique identifier. 

You can perform the following tasks to manage your Cloud organization:

* [Manage billing](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing.md)
* Manage user access to your organization: 
  * [Add members to your organization](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md)
  * [Assign roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md)
  * [Create custom roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-enterprise-orchestrator.md) (Serverless only)
  * [Configure SAML single sign-on](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/configure-saml-authentication.md) to your organization
* [Manage API keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys.md) to use with the [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud), [Elastic Cloud Billing](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud-billing/), and [Elastic Cloud Serverless](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless) APIs
* Configure who receives [operational emails](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/operational-emails.md) related to your organization
* Track the [status of Elastic Cloud services](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/service-status.md).

Several aspects of your organization can also be managed using tools provided by Elastic. For a list of tools, refer to [Elastic Cloud organization tools and APIs](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/tools-and-apis.md).
