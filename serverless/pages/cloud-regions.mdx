A region is the geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your deployment is located. Review the available Elastic serverless regions to decide which region to use. If you aren't sure which region to pick, choose a one that is geographically close to you to reduce latency. 

Elastic serverless handles all hosting details for you, and doesn't require any additional accounts with the underlying cloud provider. The region you select can't be changed after you create a project.

Currently, only limited Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions are available. More regions for AWS, as well as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), will be added in the future.
