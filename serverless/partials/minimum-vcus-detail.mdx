<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Minimum runtime VCUs">
    After you create an Elasticsearch Serverless project, to maintain basic Elasticsearch capabilities, a minimum number VCUs are always allocated to your project. These VCUs are used for the following purposes: 

    - **Ingest**: Ensure constant availability for ingesting data into your project.
    - **Search**: Maintain a data cache and support low latency searches.

    These minimum VCUs are billed at the standard rate per VCU hour.
